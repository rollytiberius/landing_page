        <h1>What Does a Car Diagnostic Test Tell You?</h1>
        <p>Diagnostic testing for cars first arrived in the UK in the 1980s, although early prototypes were
          prohibitively
          expensive. It wasn’t until the mid 90s that diagnostic machines became affordable and were available to
          garages
          like Country Vehicles. Now they’re part of our fixtures and fittings but that doesn’t mean everyone
          understands
          what they do. ‘What does a car diagnostic test tell you?’ is a question we get asked regularly, so here’s our
          answer.</p>
